For Dog Breed Classification, we have used the TensorFlow to build a Convolutional Neural Network that will help you to identify the breed of a dog from its image. In the process, we will use Transfer Learning and learn how to design, train and test models with the provided dataset. Achieved an accuracy of 73% using VGG-16 and Transfer learning.

File descriptions

train.zip – the training set, you are provided the breed for these dogs.
test.zip – the test set, you must predict the probability of each breed for each image.
sample_submission.csv – a sample submission file in the correct format.
labels.csv – the breeds for the images in the train set.
